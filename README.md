Smart Pathfinding in Transportation Systems
Overview
The Smart Pathfinding in Transportation Systems project is designed to optimize travel routes using advanced algorithms, real-time data integration, and predictive analytics. The goal of this project is to improve overall transportation efficiency, reduce travel time, and address traffic congestion by providing dynamic, data-driven routing recommendations.

Key Features
Dynamic Routing: Routes are adapted in real-time based on live traffic conditions.
Predictive Analytics: Anticipates potential traffic congestion and suggests optimal paths.
Efficiency-Focused: Minimizes travel time while enhancing the overall user experience.
Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
Libraries & Frameworks:
Pandas (Data manipulation)
NetworkX (Graph-based algorithms)
Leaflet (Mapping and geospatial visualizations)
TensorFlow / Scikit-learn (for predictive modeling)
API Integration: Google Maps API, Traffic Data APIs (for real-time data)
Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-pathfinding-transportation.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd smart-pathfinding-transportation
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up environment variables for API keys (Google Maps API, etc.), if necessary.

How It Works
Data Collection: The system gathers real-time traffic data via APIs (such as Google Maps) to understand the current traffic conditions.
Route Optimization: Using graph-based algorithms like Dijkstra or A* and predictive models, the system calculates the most efficient route based on current and predicted traffic conditions.
Dynamic Adjustments: The pathfinding algorithm adjusts the recommended route as traffic conditions change in real time.
Usage
Once installed and running, the system can be used to:

Get optimized travel routes in real-time.
View real-time traffic data and route suggestions on an interactive map.
Predict future congestion and recommend optimal rerouting to avoid delays.
